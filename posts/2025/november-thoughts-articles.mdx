Recently I started reading again because I realized I had the attention span of a goldfish...

Which was quite shocking because during high school and early uni days I would read entire books in one day,
and now I couldn't concentrate in reading few chapters.

So here's a random list of what I've been reading:
(I might make posts like this on a regular basis)

# Books

Some books I've picked up recently (so not much progress):

<br />

- [Why Fish Don't Exist, Lulu Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50887097-why-fish-don-t-exist)

  - A book about the author's obsession with David Starr Jordan & chaos.
  - I've actually picked this book up in the past, read about 30%, and just discontinued it only because I kinda forgot;
    It was only recently that I've looking in my kindle library and I've discovered the book again.
  - So far I've only read about 20% (so still before than where I left off), and honestly I don't know what
    to think about this book so far. It's a bit odd & unlike other books I've read, but not in a bad way. It's interesting enough to
    keep my attention.

- [Code, Charles Petzold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code)

  - A book about building a computer from scratch, starting from binary codes.
  - My friend recommended me this book, and I think this will actually help me understand the hardware aspect
    of the computer. I read until chapter 4? so far and it has been quite good, although some parts were slow as
    it explains some basic physics/chem knowledge that I had forgotten long ago.

- [Obsidian guide (korean)](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000213513105)

  - A guide to Obsidian written by a korean author (IDK if I should categorize it under books). I've skimmed very quickly through about 50% of the whole thing
    because I already knew most things, but the bits that I didn't know helped me fill the gaps.
  - The guide has a section on customizing your obsidian vault with CSS, and I've wanted to do that for a while (but as always, I procrastinated..)
    so this guide will helpfully force me to actually do what I want.

# Articles

Recently I've had some time to dive into internet's rabbit holes and go through articles. I've found some interesting readings that I'd like to take note of.

<br />

- [The Slow Media Manifesto](https://en.slow-media.net/manifesto)

  - Recently I've noticed myself reading more than watching when it comes to learning use things.
    A kind of related example: Few years ago I would have jumped straight into a youtube video tutorial, but now I would just go to the docs
    and usually read the quickstart or intro section, and I've found that to be more helpful.
  - Generally, due to this I think reading is a better way to absorb information at your own pace, although as a uni student I agree I don't have too much time.
    But still, while I've had time to self-learn and reflect, I've found that slow reading is the best for me.
  - So now and onwards, I'm going to try to commit to slow & deep learning (ofc if my circumstances allow me to)

- [How I read, Henrik Karklsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/how-i-read)

  - This blog post helped me motivate myself and made me rethink why and how I should read,
    with lots of reasons why you should stimulate yourself intellectually through reading.
  - I really liked this article, and I'll probably re-read it sometime again.

- [Choose Boring Technology, Dan McKinley](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

  - This article was pretty interesting - It persuades readers to embrace the boring tech. Boring doesn't equate too bad,
    rather there are many boring AND good (enough) tech out there. The good thing about the "boring" technology is that
    it's much well understood by the community, so their failures are also understood. When choosing technology, a
    shiny new technology usually has MUCH more unknown unknowns..
  - From the article:
    - A known unknown is something like: we don’t know what happens when this database hits 100% CPU.
    - An unknown unknown is something like: geez it didn’t even occur to us that writing stats would cause GC pauses.
  - It also states that when considering a new technology, first try to solve the problem with current tools &
    figure out a clear justification why you need a new stack.

<br />
I'm probably gonna update this list until November is over.
