My close friends/family might know that my website used to look like this:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwa6lkvcr/image/upload/v1753436339/nwkamimac8entdfxjahw.png)

I mean, my first motivation was to make it look like one of those pinterest cards with cute icons and stickers.
I liked this design at first, but as time passed I started to not like it as much as before..
I especially wanted to change the general color scheme too, to a more blueish color, and rearrange the layout.

So here were my main reasons:

1. I didn't like my design anymore lol, I wanted a cleaner, prettier aesthetic but also minimal at the same time?
2. My codebase was a HUGE mess. I had lots of copy and paste from old stack overflow
   forums and pages, and they were heavily unorganized. For example my CSS file had
   so many unused code snippets with various imports that were ~100 lines long, and
   they weren't even necessary.
3. I wanted to add more interactivity into the blog posts, which, with
   the Tiptap-based CMS, was limited.

# Using Mdx

First of all, I really wanted to add interactive portions to my blog posts.
One of my biggest inspirations for this is using p5.js and VPython, which
I would love to embed visual things directly.

<br />
So I decided to not use MongoDB for storing blog posts but instead use MDX directly
in my repo and save them there. This also meant saying good-byt to the CMS I built
(which I don't particularly regret because it gave me very good practice).

# The layout

I moved the categories up and made it horizontal. I had initially made it vertical because I thought
I will expand my website with more categories, hence moving down would look better than moving sideways.
But now I changed my mind and wanted a more minimal design with less clutter.

<br />I also was considering a separate `about` page, but I didn't really know
what to put in there that weren't already on the home page, so I just combined
them.

# The style

I really wanted to go for the old <span className="microsoftFont">Windows-98 aesthetics</span>.
While looking for fonts, I had considered many similar ones, but I discovered that the <a href="https://martyr.shop/products/ms-w98-ui" className="microsoftFont textLink">MS W98 UI font</a> was free to use, so I got it.

# Overall

I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome, although I still have many features to add. (This post will probably continue to update)
