# Resolutions

Each year I set a list of new year resolutions and actually forget about them halfway throughout the year.
But this year hopefully I can get to keep them for once.

<br />
📍NOTE: most of these are valid until September 2026 lol
<br />

- Career stuffs
  - Leetcode grind (number 1 priority rn)
    - finish neetcode 150
    - finish challenge with coding club
  - Internship grind
    - between 1~9 in korea
    - 9~12 in the US (for next year summer)
  - Study
    - database - cs50 db + udemy courses
    - cloud engineering - AWS SAA
    - java/springboot
    - make simple review sheets of courses (prob will take some time)
- Life stuffs
  - read 1 book & write 1 post per month
  - dentist
  - whole lots of shopping once I get the bag
  - make some art!!
  - work on website

<br />
So this looks fairly ambitious but I have 9 months until I return back to uni,
so I might just as well use my time wisely. I do have to look for signs of
burnout though, so gotta be careful.

(I also have some resolutions I didn't include,
like reading specific books or travelling.. they do exist but aren't
priorities, or they are uncertain.)

# Trying to get everything together

So far, January has been like my "prepping" month where I just caught up on the things
I feel like I should have been doing a looonog time ago, like preparing interviews, leetcoding,
editing resumes/portfolios, etc.

<br />

- I've made 4 master google docs to get my shit together.
  - **Interview doc** - A doc with all QnAs for all past projects/research/internships + STAR method + behavioral (for interview prep)
    - By FAR the BIGGEST google doc ever I've made so far lmao
  - **UW + job search doc** - A doc with all necessary info for job search + UW degree (international student info, visa, housing, courses, etc)
  - **Leetcode masterlist** - A doc with leetcode questions + answers, mostly just summarized the most important stuff I need to remember (the "tricks" and edge cases, etc)
  - **Internship tracker** - A doc that tracks all internship applications

- Started **Notion** again (for planner purposes)
  - I wrote my plans and goals per month, and what I want to do before Sept 2026.
  - I just kinda wanted to separate my life/productivity stuffs from my Obsidian vault
- Finished polishing/updating **resume/portfolio**
  - This took WAY longer than expected .... especially the portfolio (And I can't believe the number of slides on this thing💀☠️).
  - This is pretty much mandatory to find any part-time job/internships here in Korea.
  - Also I realized I have about 10+ versions of my resume, and I recently saw the first few versions I had made and it looked really bad lol,
    so improvement right there.

- Also I've finally started using google calendar, realized how chaotic my
  schedule was..🥀🥀

    className="w-[40rem]"

  <br />

So... many of these are just some things I actually think should have started waaay
earlier, like back in freshman year (why didn't I do them lmao).... ESPECIALLY the part about the
visa and international student info. Like GIRL what have I been doing all this time and
how did I survive until now. While organizing that doc I felt the missing pieces coming together
that I procrastinated for YEARS just because I was too lazy to research😭

<br />
But you can't go back in time, right. Thinking about what I could have done in
the past & getting worried about them solves 0 problems.

# But also..

  className="w-[18rem]"
/>
Bc I've been mostly stressed for the many parts of my life and I don't want to
be living that way anymore. Well ofc I will still need to grind and whatnot, but
for the most part I think I should approach life less seriously.
<br />
So I'd have to remind myself to be more flexible and easy going, which,
hopefully, won't be too hard. There are too much good vibes in life I can't miss
out.

Happy late new year! :-)
